# Project Resume — Gleam Pro Cleaning Website

This file explains how to resume work on this project without prior context.

---

## Repository

- Repo: https://github.com/iLongRanger/gleamProCleaning
- Branch: `main`

---

## Project Goal

Rebuild the Gleam Pro website as a **commercial-first cleaning business** with a
clear B2B conversion flow focused on **Request a Free Walk-Through**.

Target clients:

- Restaurants & pubs
- Offices
- Community facilities / schools

---

## Development Workflow

- Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- Track changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Keep commits small and incremental
- Test locally before committing

---

## Current State (IMPORTANT)

- Homepage repositioned for commercial cleaning
- Primary CTA: **Request a Free Walk-Through**
- Walk-through page exists at `/request-walkthrough`
- Header CTA routes correctly
- Security patches applied (Next.js / React)
- Vercel deploys successfully

---

## What Is NOT Done Yet

- Walk-through request form (RFQ-style) is not implemented
- No backend or email submission yet
- Commercial service hub page not created
- Restaurant / Office / Facility sub-pages not created

---

## Next Planned Commit

feat(website): add walk-through request form and submission flow

This will:

- Replace the placeholder on `/request-walkthrough`
- Add a B2B RFQ-style form
- Add a success/confirmation state

---

## How to Resume in a New Chat

Paste the following:

> Repo: https://github.com/iLongRanger/gleamProCleaning  
> Last commit: `234a04c feat(website): add request walkthrough page and route`  
> Please read `CHANGELOG.md` and `RESUME.md` and continue with the next planned commit.
